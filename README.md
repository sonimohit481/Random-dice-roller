The **Dice Roll Game** is an interactive web application designed to roll dice for players, track their results, and declare winners. There are two versions of the app:

- **Version 1**: A simple random dice roller for three players with visual feedback.
- **Version 2**: A customizable dice roller that allows users to select the number of dice and view a history of previous rolls.

2. **Version 2**: Select the number of dice you want to roll and click "Roll The Dice." The dice results are displayed, and the winner is determined based on the highest roll. You can also view the history of all previous rolls.
